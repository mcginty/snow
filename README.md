An implementation of Trevor Perrin's [Noise Protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/) that
is designed to be Hard To Fuck Upâ„¢.

ðŸ”¥ **Warning** ðŸ”¥ This library has not received any formal audit.

## What's it look like?

See `examples/simple.rs` for a more complete TCP client/server example.

```rust
let mut noise = snow::Builder::new("Noise_NN_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s".parse()?)
                    .build_initiator()?;

let mut buf = [0u8; 65535];

// write first handshake message
noise.write_message(&[], &mut buf)?;

// receive response message
let incoming = receive_message_from_the_mysterious_ether();
noise.read_message(&incoming, &mut buf)?;

// complete handshake, and transition the state machine into transport mode
let mut noise = noise.into_transport_mode()?;
```

See the full documentation at [https://docs.rs/snow](https://docs.rs/snow).

## Implemented

Snow is currently tracking against [Noise spec revision 34](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise_rev34.html).

However, a not all features have been implemented yet (pull requests welcome):

- [ ] [The `fallback` modifier](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise_rev34.html#the-fallback-modifier)

## Crypto

Cryptographic providers are swappable through `Builder::with_resolver()`, but by default
it chooses select, artisanal pure-Rust implementations (see `Cargo.toml` for a quick
overview).

### Other Providers

#### ring

[ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) is a crypto library based off of BoringSSL
and is significantly faster than most of the pure-Rust implementations.

If you enable the `ring-resolver` feature, Snow will include a `resolvers::ring` module
as well as a `RingAcceleratedResolver` available to be used with
`Builder::with_resolver()`.

If you enable the `ring-accelerated` feature, Snow will default to choosing `ring`'s
crypto implementations when available.

#### libsodium

[libsodium](https://libsodium.org/) is a fork of NaCl focused on improved usability
and regular maintenance.

##### Compatibility caveat

libsodium [blacklists a set of low-order points](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/crypto_scalarmult/curve25519/ref10/x25519_ref10.c#L20)
that it deems unsafe because they would output an all-zeroes result.

Noise [does not validate Curve25519 points](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/noise/2017/000971.html),
so if another Noise implementation provides an all-zero (or another low-order) public
key for some reason (be it testing, or a real life foot-shot), if you use the libsodium
backend of snow, it will error in a way that's not fully compatible with the
specification.
